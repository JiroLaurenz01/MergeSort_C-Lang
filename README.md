# MergeSort_C-Lang
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in the C programming language. Merge Sort is an efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array or a list in ascending order. It divides the input into smaller halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted output.
